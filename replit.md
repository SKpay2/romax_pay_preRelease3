# CryptoPay Mini - Telegram Mini App

## Overview
CryptoPay Mini is a production-ready Telegram Mini App designed for secure and efficient cryptocurrency payment wallet management within Telegram's WebView. It enables users to manage USDT (TRC20) balances, view real-time exchange rates to Russian Rubles (RUB), create payment requests, and track transaction history. The application features a bold Neo-Brutalist design and a full-stack architecture utilizing PostgreSQL, Express.js, and React. Its primary purpose is to provide a seamless crypto transaction platform within Telegram.

## Recent Changes (November 16, 2025)
- **Fixed Operator Panel infinite render loop**: Removed `toast` from `useCallback` dependencies to prevent infinite re-render cycles
- **Fixed Operator Panel authentication**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch requests to properly send session cookies
- **Fixed string to number conversion**: Added `Number()` wrapper to all `.toFixed()` and `.toLocaleString()` calls for data from API
- **Improved UX in Operator Panel**: Removed misleading payment counters from tabs; added "Details" button for completed payments
- **Added Statistics tab in Operator Panel**: Operators can now view comprehensive statistics including total/paid/rejected counts, amounts in RUB and USDT, and conversion rate
- **Operator Panel now fully functional**: Login, payment loading, status toggling, payment processing, detail viewing, and statistics tracking all work correctly
- **Added Admin Panel operator management features**:
  - Admins can view individual operator statistics (total/successful/rejected payments, amounts, conversion rates)
  - **Fixed**: Average conversion rate (RUB/USDT) now calculates correctly based on totalAmountRub / totalAmountUsdt
  - Admins can edit operator credentials (change login and/or password)
  - **Added**: Beautiful confirmation dialog for operator deletion with humorous text "Уверен, что хочешь удалить? Раб останется без хозяина 😢"
  - Added new API endpoints: `/api/admin/operators/:id/statistics` (GET) and `/api/admin/operators/:id/credentials` (PATCH)
  - All features accessible via buttons in operators table in admin panel

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18+ and TypeScript, using Vite for development. It utilizes `shadcn/ui` (New York variant) based on Radix UI, styled with Tailwind CSS, to achieve a Neo-Brutalist aesthetic. This design is characterized by thick borders, harsh drop shadows, vibrant colors, zero border-radius, high contrast typography (Inter font), and asymmetrical layouts. State management is handled with React Query for server state and local component state, avoiding a global state library. The application is a single-page application with component-based screen switching for core functionalities like Dashboard, TopUp, Pay, History, Support, and Settings. All text content is in Russian. It integrates with the Telegram WebApp SDK for features like authentication (`initData` validation), theme management, and viewport control, with a fallback demo mode for non-Telegram environments.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js server developed with TypeScript. It integrates custom Vite middleware for development and production middleware for security and performance (e.g., Helmet, CORS, `express-rate-limit`). It also includes Telegram bot integration via `node-telegram-bot-api`. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries. The API is RESTful, using JSON, and includes endpoints for user authentication, profile/balance management, payment request handling, notifications, real-time exchange rates, and a webhook for Telegram bot events.

### Data Storage Solutions
The PostgreSQL database uses Replit's managed PostgreSQL (Neon-backed) service. Database schema includes `users`, `payment_requests`, `notifications`, `deposits`, `operators`, and `tron_scan_state` tables. Financial data, such as USDT balances and transaction amounts, uses high-precision numeric types (e.g., numeric 18,8) to prevent calculation errors. BigInt-based arithmetic is used throughout the application to maintain 8-decimal precision for all USDT amounts.

**Database Configuration:**
- Development and production use the same `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Connection string is automatically configured and works across all deployment types
- Schema migrations are managed via `npm run db:push` command

**Automated Deposit Uniqueness:**
- Each automated deposit request generates a unique `payable_amount` for blockchain identification
- Uniqueness is enforced at 2-decimal precision (e.g., 100.00, 99.99, 99.98)
- When duplicate amounts exist, the system decrements/increments by 0.01 USDT alternately
- Pattern: 100.00 → 99.99 → 100.01 → 99.98 → 100.02 → 99.97 → 100.03
- Maximum deviation: ±10 USDT from requested amount (allows ~2000 concurrent deposits per amount)
- Users can create multiple active deposits simultaneously (no per-user limit)

### Admin Panel
The admin panel features password-based authentication (configured via `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable). It allows operators to view and process pending payment requests, modify payment amounts (with automatic balance validation), add admin comments, view receipt attachments inline, approve TRC20 USDT deposits, and unified authentication across all admin endpoints. The deposits table displays the exact `payable_amount` (with full 8-decimal precision when needed) to help operators identify blockchain transactions accurately.

### Authentication and Authorization
Authentication is secured via Telegram WebApp `initData` validation, identifying users by their Telegram ID. New users are automatically provisioned upon their first authentication. The application also supports a demo mode when accessed outside the Telegram environment.
